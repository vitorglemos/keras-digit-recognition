## Convolutional Neural Network

Learn computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data. This project is part of a series of kernels to solve various Machine Learning issues in Kaggle Community. Here, I used a convolutional neural network to solve the digit recognition problem. Besides that, 
I worked with the Keras library, combined with the computational power of GPUs to increase the speed of sample training. In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual image.

## Kaggle Community 

[KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com) is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by [Google LLC](https://about.google/). Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. Kaggle got its start by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench for data science, and short form AI education. On 8 March 2017, Google announced that they were acquiring Kaggle.

## Keras Library

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), or (PlaidML)[https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml]. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. 

## Competition Description

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
